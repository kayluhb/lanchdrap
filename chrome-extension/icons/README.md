# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editing software or online icon generators. The icons should represent the lunch rating concept (e.g., a fork and knife, a star, or a food-related symbol).

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG
- Background: Transparent or solid color
- Style: Simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Colors: Should work well with the extension's color scheme (reds and oranges)
